"""Generate navigation items for the jupyter notebooks.

The script runs in the root folder, but the relative paths need be built
relative to the applications folder. Each call to "mkdocs_gen_files" is
relative to the docs folder.

We want to produce a SUMMARY.md file that looks like the following:
* [Applications](index.md)
* N2V
    * [2D SEM](N2V/2D_SEM.ipynb)
    * [3D SEM](N2V/3D_SEM.ipynb)
* CARE
    * [2D SEM](CARE/2D_SEM.ipynb)
etc.
